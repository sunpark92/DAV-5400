    "## Introduction\n",
    "### Bike Sharing service\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, there are many ride-sharing companies that offer users to share car rides, or ride electric scooters or bikes. These companies are very popular, and Uber and Lyft are even called \"unicorns,\" which are startup companies valued at over $1 billion. Lime or Birds, the electric scooter-sharing startup companies, are also popular in San Francisco, Chicago and even in Paris. However, bike sharing is the most worthy of notice to be analyzed now and even for the future. It is because people face practical and realistic problems when sharing and cars and electric scooters which do not exist when people share bikes. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, with car sharing, people have to get a driver's license. They also have to have car insurance and they have to pay extra costs for gas or tiny scratches that might be occur while driving. Regarding electric scooters, safety is considered to be an issue. In California, Electric Scooter Helmet Laws took effect in 2019. However, it is hard to bring a helmet to ride an electric scooter because people usually take a scooter when they go shorter distances than when they go with a car or a bike. \n",
    "\n",
    "A bike can solve these problems. People do not have to have a car insurance or a driver's license. A bike is also safer than an electric scooter. According to a study from medical journal JAMA Network Open, more people were injured while riding electric scooters than by riding bicycles. This study also figured out that only 4.4% of injured scooter riders were wearing a helmet even though California law required helmet use while operating electric scooters during the entire study period."

    "## Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various factors that affect people using this bike sharing service. I will expect the factors will be When (specific time) and /HOW MANY people will use this sharing service. For example, people usually use this service during the daytime more than at dawn or late at night. People also use this service on sunny days more than rainy days. In addition, people may use this service in the summer more than during winter.\n",
    "Thus, the questions that I should take into account are\n",
    "\n",
    "- __When (specific time) do people mostly use this bike-sharing service?__\n",
    "\n",
    "- __With the answer from analyzing the first question, why do people usually use this service?__\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Among the given conditions (season, weather, week days, holidays, etc) what are noticeable factors that affect usage?__\n"

    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "For you second data set you state: \"The second data set will be collected come from the company's official website, Instagram account and application \". You should provide links to these sources and also explain how you will collect data from those websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I am going to investigate the ride-sharing market first. Then I will start analyzing the data from Kaggle to understand what are considered to be influential factors for the bike-sharing service. There are two CSV files in this data set: 1) day.csv and 2)hour.csv. The first one has 731 records and the second one has 17,379 records.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, I am going to do data cleansing by changing the datetime column. After this, for more effective analysis and after answering the first question, I will analyze the year and month together. For example, I will divide the year and month into 24 parts from 2011/1 ~ 2012/12. After this, I will use time, working day and holiday data with the visualized graphs to analyze when people usually use this service.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will store the data related to usage of this service in a SQL database. \n",
    "First of all, I will analyze what events/promotions they held from researching company's official website, Instagram account and application. And then I will extract data about change in usage of this service during the same period. Also, I am going to research application as well to investigate how many bikes/how many places they are offering this service to figure out where/why they are investing for their business in the future.
