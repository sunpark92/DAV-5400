    "I’ve had an interest in sports and sports journalism since I was an undergraduate student. Especially, when I lived in San Francisco, sometimes I watched Golden State Warrior’s game with my co-workers who really loves watching basketball games! As of that time, I really wanted to learn about basketball even though I did not know anything about basketball untill that time.  \n",
    "With this data, I think I can know who are the best/good defenders and learn about basketball more while analyzing the data set. \n",

    "I think I should ask/adjust the standard to analyze data first. For example, I would ask *‘which seasons were used?’, ‘which location did players stand for shooting?’, ‘who was the best/worst defender in a specific year?’, etc*. I will answer the questions based on the analyzed data set. "
